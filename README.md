# Infrastructure using CDK

I've designed this repo to be standalone and seperate from the project. This will be my best exmaple of showing what i can do with AWS's CDK. The repo attached to this project will be linked below once it's set up and built.

## Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
